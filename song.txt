Lyrics
Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battlefield
Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines, move as one
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears and shields are linked
In a much stronger chain
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
All are one and one is all
Shield by shield we'll never fall
All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
All are one and one is all
Shield by shield we'll never fall
Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Charge with force, break their ranks
No remorse, crush their flanks
Pulverize their human wall
We shall destroy!
